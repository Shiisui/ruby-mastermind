# Elements of the game: 

#- 6 colors 

#- 4 pegs 

#- 12 turns 

#- 4 color slots 


# goal of the game: 

# guess the code within 12 turns

# each turn receive feedback (4 pegs)
# pegs are either white or red and 
# if it's the right color and in the right
# order you will get a red peg for that one color
# if it's the right color but not the right 
# order you will get a white peg

# GOAL : Able to play mastermind vs a computer 

# 2. input from user = 4 colors, 6 colors available. 
# can input 4 colors at each turn
# 
# 3. ouput: return 0-4 pegs if right color and order 
# red peg elsif right color but false order return white peg
# 


# 4. Steps 

# 1. create 6 colors

# 2. create 4 pegs output, and create 4 variables for 
# user color input

# 3. create a loop from 0 -> 12

# 4. create a class player and divide it to computer and human

# 5. give computer the ability to choose 4 random colors 
# from the list of 6 colors. Before the start of the game.

# 6. Make the human able to input 4 colors each turn and them to
# a method that will compare the code and the breaker-code

# 7. create a method that will detect each color and if it's in the same order
# as the original code and have the same color, will give a red peg

# 8. create a program that will detect each color and if it's the same color but not the same order 
# will give a white peg 

# 9. the good order + good color take precedence over the good color alone

# 10. outputs the pegs

# 11. until the end of the 12 turns or, the code is broken, continue the game.
